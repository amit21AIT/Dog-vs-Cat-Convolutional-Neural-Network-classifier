# Dog-vs-Cat-Convolutional-Neural-Network-classifier
It is a Convolution Neural Network(CNN) Classifier for Classifying dog and cat images using Keras and Tensorflow backend.


Test Train Split
Image training set contain 10,000 images i.e 5,000 each category. I split those into 80% train and 20% means test Split each class images into 8,000 for train and 2,000 for test.

Network Parameters:

  1)Rectifier Linear Unit
  
  2)Adam optimizer
  
  3)Sigmoid on Final output
  
  4)Binary CrossEntropy loss
